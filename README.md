This project consists of 3 artifacts:

-  [*google-auth-library-credentials*](#google-auth-library-credentials): contains base classes and
interfaces for Google credentials
-  [*google-auth-library-appengine*](#google-auth-library-appengine): contains App Engine
credentials. This artifact depends on the App Engine SDK.
-  [*google-auth-library-oauth2-http*](#google-auth-library-oauth2-http): contains a wide variety of
credentials as well as utility methods to create them and to get Application Default Credentials

> Note: This client is a work-in-progress, and may occasionally
> make backwards-incompatible changes.

## Quickstart

If you are using Maven, add this to your pom.xml file (notice that you can replace
`google-auth-library-oauth2-http` with any of `google-auth-library-credentials` and
`google-auth-library-appengine`, depending on your application needs):

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start:google-auth-library-oauth2-http:released})

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.google.auth</groupId>
  <artifactId>google-auth-library-oauth2-http</artifactId>
  <version>0.17.0</version>
</dependency>
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})


If you are using Gradle, add this to your dependencies

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start:google-auth-library-oauth2-http:released})
```Groovy
compile 'com.google.auth:google-auth-library-oauth2-http:0.17.0'
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

If you are using SBT, add this to your dependencies

[//]: # ({x-version-update-start:google-auth-library-oauth2-http:released})
```Scala
libraryDependencies += "com.google.auth" % "google-auth-library-oauth2-http" % "0.17.0"
```
[//]: # ({x-version-update-end})

## google-auth-library-credentials

This artifact contains base classes and interfaces for Google credentials:
- `Credentials`: base class for an authorized identity. Implementations of this class can be used to
authorize your application
- `RequestMetadataCallback`: interface for the callback that receives the result of the asynchronous
`Credentials.getRequestMetadata(URI, Executor, RequestMetadataCallback)`
- `ServiceAccountSigner`: interface for a service account signer. Implementations of this class are
capable of signing byte arrays using the credentials associated to a Google Service Account

## google-auth-library-appengine

This artifact depends on the App Engine SDK (`appengine-api-1.0-sdk`) and should be used only by
applications running on App Engine environments that use urlfetch. The `AppEngineCredentials` class
allows you to authorize your App Engine application given an instance of
[AppIdentityService][appengine-app-identity-service].

You can install the App Engine SDK from Maven Central:

```bash
$ mvn dependency:get -Dartifact=com.google.appengine:appengine-api-1.0-sdk:1.9.74
```

Usage:

```java
import com.google.appengine.api.appidentity.AppIdentityService;
import com.google.appengine.api.appidentity.AppIdentityServiceFactory;
import com.google.auth.Credentials;
import com.google.auth.appengine.AppEngineCredentials;

AppIdentityService appIdentityService = AppIdentityServiceFactory.getAppIdentityService();

Credentials credentials =
    AppEngineCredentials.newBuilder()
        .setScopes(...)
        .setAppIdentityService(appIdentityService)
        .build();
```

**Important: Note that `com.google.auth.appengine.AppEngineCredentials` is a separate class from
`com.google.auth.oauth2.AppEngineCredentials`.**

You can find [all available versions][appengine-sdk-versions] on Maven Central.

### Application Default Credentials

This artifact contains a wide variety of credentials as well as utility methods to create them and
to get Application Default Credentials.
Credentials classes contained in this artifact are:
- `CloudShellCredentials`: credentials for Google Cloud Shell built-in service account
- `ComputeEngineCredentials`: credentials for Google Compute Engine built-in service account
- `OAuth2Credentials`: base class for OAuth2-based credentials
- `ServiceAccountCredentials`: credentials for a Service Account - use a JSON Web Token (JWT) to get
access tokens
- `ServiceAccountJwtAccessCredentials`: credentials for a Service Account - use JSON Web Token (JWT)
directly in the request metadata to provide authorization
- `UserCredentials`: credentials for a user identity and consent

To get Application Default Credentials use `GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault()` or
`GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault(HttpTransportFactory)`. These methods return the
Application Default Credentials which are used to identify and authorize the whole application. The
following are searched (in order) to find the Application Default Credentials:

1. Credentials file pointed to by the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable
2. Credentials provided by the Google Cloud SDK `gcloud auth application-default login` command
3. Google App Engine built-in credentials
4. Google Cloud Shell built-in credentials
5. Google Compute Engine built-in credentials
   - Skip this check by setting the environment variable `NO_GCE_CHECK=true`
   - Customize the GCE metadata server address by setting the environment variable `GCE_METADATA_HOST=<hostname>`

### Explicit Credential Loading

To get Credentials from a Service Account JSON key use `GoogleCredentials.fromStream(InputStream)`
or `GoogleCredentials.fromStream(InputStream, HttpTransportFactory)`. Note that the credentials must
be refreshed before the access token is available.

```java
GoogleCredentials credentials = GoogleCredentials.fromStream(new FileInputStream("/path/to/credentials.json"));
credentials.refreshIfExpired();
AccessToken token = credentials.getAccessToken();
// OR
AccessToken token = credentials.refreshAccessToken();
```

### ImpersonatedCredentials

Allows a credentials issued to a user or service account to
impersonate another.  The source project using ImpersonaedCredentials must enable the
"IAMCredentials" API.  Also, the target service account must grant the orginating principal
the "Service Account Token Creator" IAM role.

```java
String credPath = "/path/to/svc_account.json";
ServiceAccountCredentials sourceCredentials = ServiceAccountCredentials
     .fromStream(new FileInputStream(credPath));
sourceCredentials = (ServiceAccountCredentials) sourceCredentials
    .createScoped(Arrays.asList("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/iam"));

ImpersonatedCredentials targetCredentials = ImpersonatedCredentials.create(sourceCredentials,
    "impersonated-account@project.iam.gserviceaccount.com", null,
    Arrays.asList("https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only"), 300);

Storage storage_service = StorageOptions.newBuilder().setProjectId("project-id")
    .setCredentials(targetCredentials).build().getService();

for (Bucket b : storage_service.list().iterateAll())
    System.out.println(b); 
```

## Using Credentials with `google-http-client`

Credentials provided by `google-auth-library` can be used with Google's [HTTP-based clients][apiary-clients]. We provide a [`HttpCredentialsAdapter`][http-credentials-adapter] which can be used as an [`HttpRequestInitializer`][http-request-initializer].

```java
import com.google.api.client.http.HttpRequestInitializer;
import com.google.api.services.bigquery.Bigquery;
import com.google.auth.http.HttpCredentialsAdapter;
import com.google.auth.oauth2.GoogleCredentials;

GoogleCredentials credentials = GoogleCredentials.getApplicationDefault();
HttpRequestInitializer requestInitializer = new HttpCredentialsAdapter(credentials);

Bigquery bq = new Bigquery.Builder(HTTP_TRANSPORT, JSON_FACTORY, requestInitializer)
    .setApplicationName(APPLICATION_NAME)
    .build();
```
